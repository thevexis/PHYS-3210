# Computational Techniques in Physics (PHYS 3210)

This course is the study of computational techniques applicable to physics.
Techniques examined are applied to solve problems from various areas of (astro)physics
and other areas of science.

## Class
MWF 10:00 &mdash; 10:50 in Rogers 103

Instructor: Gregory A. Feiden, Ph.D.

Office Hours: WF 14:00 &ndash; 16:00, TR 13:00 &ndash; 14:00

## Learning Objectives
 - write software using Python
 - select an appropriate numerical technique to solve a problem
 - solve physical problems using a computer (here, with Python)

Note that it is not a goal of this course to teach you basic programming skills
that can be developed by taking one of UNG's computer science courses (CSCI 1301
or 1371). We will take time to learn those basic skills as they are applied in
Python, since our intro courses only teach MatLAB and Java.

## Course Schedule
Take a look at the [Schedule](https://github.com/gfeiden/PHYS-3210/blob/master/Schedule.md) page to see our tentative schedule. 

## Textbooks
There are two required textbooks for this course. Both will serve you well in the
course, but are excellent references even after you leave this course.

   _Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Python_, 3ed, by Landau, Paez, &amp; Bordeianu ($50)

   _A Student's Guide to Python for Physical Modeling_ by Kinder &amp; Nelson ($18)

## Software
[Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (w/ Spyder, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, VPython)

## Evaluation &amp; Assessment
You will be evaluated and assessed with five different metrics: In-Class Exercises,
Homework, Independent Project, 3 Midterms, and a cumulative Final Exam.

 | Category  | Weight |
 |-----------|  :---: |
 | Exercises |  25%   |
 | Labs      |  15%   |
 | Project   |  15%   |
 | Midterms  |  30%   |
 | Final     |  15%   |

To be clear, each midterm exam is weighted at 10%, for a total of 30% across the
three midterms.

### In-Class Exercises
During a typical week, Monday and Wednesday will be reserved for working through
tutorial exercises that guide you through a particular skill or set of skills. This
may include 10 - 15 minutes for a short lecture to reinforce and/or clarify material
presented in your textbook that will be relevant for the day's exercise(s).

### Labs
Fridays are reserved for working through more complicated problems that require
applying skills learned on Monday and Wednesday. It's essentially a lab day where
the problems may carry over as homework. They will require write ups that include
derivations, description of your methodology, and analysis of your results.

### Project
You are required to undertake an independent project to solve a real-world problem
using techniques learned in class or those contained in later chapters of _Computational
Physics_.

### Midterms
You'll have three midterm exams on __20 September 2019__, __25 October 2019__, and
__21 November 2019__. They will largely be testing your understanding of when a
particular method is applicable and the conceptual basis for various numerical
techniques. All coding on midterms will be written as pseudo-code.

### Final Exam
There will be a cumulative final exam on __Monday 09 December 2019__ at 10:20 in
Rogers 103. It will be a similar format as the midterms and may have a take-home
component.

### Grading Scale
| Percentage | Letter Grade |
|   :---:    |     :---:    |
|    93+     |       A      |
|  83 - 92   |       B      |
|  70 - 82   |       C      |
|  60 - 70   |       D      |
|   < 60     |       F      |
