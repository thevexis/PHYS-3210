## Week 10: Ordinary Differential Equations &ndash; Non-linear Oscillations

### Readings
From _Computational Physics_:
 1. Section 8.4 &amp; 8.5 (by Wednesday)
 2. Section 8.6 &amp; 8.7 (by Friday)

### Lab 05: Friction, Resonances, &amp; Beats
_Based on Problems in Section 8.9 &amp; 8.10 in Computational Physics_

Now that you have a working anharmonic oscillator code, you are going to 
explore how external forces affect the oscillations of an anharmonic 
oscillator. 

 1. Explore the impact of friction by completing parts 1 &ndash; 3 in 
    Problem 8.9.1 (pg 189).
 
 2. Next, explore how the timing of a driving forces affects the amplitude
    of your oscillations by completing parts 1 &ndash; 9 in Problem 8.10.
