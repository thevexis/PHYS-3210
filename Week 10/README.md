### Exercise 19: Anharmonic Oscillation with Euler's method
_Based on Problem in Section 8.8 in Computational Physics_

Use Euler's method to solve for an anharmonic oscillator's motion that 
is subject to the spring potential

Do not introduce time-dependent external forces, yet. Explore solutions 
using different values for the exponent _p_ between 2 and 12. 

 1. If _p = 2_, do you get a result that you expect? Explain.

 2. Check that the solution remains periodic with constant amplitude and
    period fo ra given initial condition, regardless of how non-linear 
    you make the force.
 
 3. Where is along it's path does the oscillating mass have the highest
    velocity? Does this make physical sense? Explain. (if it doesn't make
    sense, go back and check your work!)
 
 4. Verify that nonharmonic oscillators are _isochronous_, that is, vibrations
    with different amplitudes have different periods.
