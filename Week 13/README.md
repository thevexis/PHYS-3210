## Week 13: Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations

### Readings
From _Computational Physics_:
 1. Sections 9.4 (by Wednesday)

### Exercise 23: Classical Chaotic Scattering
_Based on Problem 9.4 in Computational Physics_

Model the trajectory of a ball bouncing off of bumpers in
a pinball machine by adopting a static 2D potential

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V%28x%2Cy%29%20%3D%20%5Cpm%20x%5E2y%5E2%5Ctextup%7Be%7D%5E%7B-%28x%5E2&plus;y%5E2%29%7D)

Use either an Eulerian method or RK2 to solve for the ball's
trajectory is 2D (x-y) space. Experiment with different initial
conditions to see how the ball behaves.
